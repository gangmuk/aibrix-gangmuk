Here is my prompt. 润色一下，使其更通顺，更有逻辑，更有专业性：Organic matter degradation in marine sediments is mediated by a series of microbial redox reactions that decrease in energy yield, ranging from oxic respiration, denitrification, Mn reduction, Fe reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis (Jarvis et al., 1994; Pufahl and Groat, 2017). The lower phosphorites were formed in an anoxic water environment, where oxygen in overlying water was limited during diagenesis. In this scenario, bacteria-driven breakdown of organic matter is very efficient especially in the presence of microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) (Arning et al., 2009; Hiatt et al., 2015). The presence of pyrite framboids in lower phosphorites is indicative of an authigenic microbial origin and suggests the presence of sulfate, which would fuel sulfate reduction (Hiatt et al., 2015; Hiatt et al., 2020). The increased supply of sulfate from oxidative weathering into the Ediacaran ocean (Laakso et al., 2020) likely fueled the microbial sulfate reduction and, thus organic matter degradation (Chen et al., 2022). Pyrite precipitates in the zone of sulfate reduction when ferrous Fe from Fe(oxyhydr)oxides dissolution combines with bacterially reduced sulfide (Pufahl, 2010). In addition, the observation of sulfur bacteria in Zhangcunping lower phosphorites supports our view (Bailey et al., 2013).\n\nAssistant:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=2048, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None), prompt_token_ids: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

If we execute the search query above with the input query string "Abc" and filter by `OrganisationId` with the value of the shared organization, both "Abcd test" and "ttabcd testtest" documents will be returned in the search results.\n\nThis is because the ngram tokenizer will generate the following ngrams for each document:\n\n* "Abcd test": "ab", "abc", "abcd", "cd", "cd ", "d ", "te", "tes", "test", "es", "est"\n* "ttabcd testtest": "tt", "ttabc", "tabc", "abcd", "bcd ", "cd t", "d te", " tes", "test", "testt", "estt", "stte", "ttes", "test", "est"\n\nBoth documents have the ngram "abc", which is a partial match for the input query string "Abc", so they will both be returned in the search results. However, "Abcd test" will have a higher relevance score because it has a closer match to the input query string than "ttabcd testtest". The score of a document depends on how many of its fields match the input query string and how closely they match.\n\nAssistant:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=2048, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None), prompt_token_ids: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.
