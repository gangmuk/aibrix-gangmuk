It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

Here is my prompt. 润色一下，使其更通顺，更有逻辑，更有专业性：Organic matter degradation in marine sediments is mediated by a series of microbial redox reactions that decrease in energy yield, ranging from oxic respiration, denitrification, Mn reduction, Fe reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis (Jarvis et al., 1994; Pufahl and Groat, 2017). The lower phosphorites were formed in an anoxic water environment, where oxygen in overlying water was limited during diagenesis. In this scenario, bacteria-driven breakdown of organic matter is very efficient especially in the presence of microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) (Arning et al., 2009; Hiatt et al., 2015). The presence of pyrite framboids in lower phosphorites is indicative of an authigenic microbial origin and suggests the presence of sulfate, which would fuel sulfate reduction (Hiatt et al., 2015; Hiatt et al., 2020). The increased supply of sulfate from oxidative weathering into the Ediacaran ocean (Laakso et al., 2020) likely fueled the microbial sulfate reduction and, thus organic matter degradation (Chen et al., 2022). Pyrite precipitates in the zone of sulfate reduction when ferrous Fe from Fe(oxyhydr)oxides dissolution combines with bacterially reduced sulfide (Pufahl, 2010). In addition, the observation of sulfur bacteria in Zhangcunping lower phosphorites supports our view (Bailey et al., 2013).\n\nAssistant:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=2048, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None), prompt_token_ids: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I have a Saas Company Called Fitclass.com. It is a fitness marketplace where trainers and instructors can list the virtual classes that they do use zoom. The platform integrates with zoom. The attendees can search and browse fitness categories, classes, and trainers. They can follow and book free and paid classes. We are competing with the old-school training where you have to go to your local gym. Since it uses Zoom, the trainer can train people from their home, home gym, or studio. And this also allowed the attendee to work out from home just by watching the Zoom class on their laptop or casting it to their TV in any room of their house. The attendee can shut off their webcam if they like. Working out at home has many benefits, such as not having to pay to belong to a gym or drive to a gym. It also removes the embarrassment and anxiety a person can sometimes have when they first join a gym, and they are out of shape, and everyone else is in shape. Working out at home, they can leave the webcam on or off. And for the disabled, obese, or elderly can even participate right from a chair, couch, bed, or rake rests without feeling like they don't belong in the class. This also has many benefits for the trainer too. Instead of driving to a gym and cutting deals with gyms, they can use the site as a social media platform to get thousands or even millions of followers.\nBut most importantly, if you live in a small rural town in a faraway country, instead of having to serve a small local base of clients, you can now reach millions of people globally, meaning you can use the integrated Zoom platform (Since Fitclass is official partners with Zoom,) to have classes with dozens or even several hundred people. You can charge for classes, but the best thing about our system is our built-in Tips or tipping system. Fitclass encourages our trainers to not have a paywall for their classes or to charge people for their classes. This will limit exposure. By doing classes for Free, it's like Twitch or Youtube live. You, in fact, become a health streamer. You can look at FitClass as a health Streaming Platform. Twitch is for gamers, Youtube live is for content creators, and fitclass.com is for health and wellness professionals to stream their classes live to a global audience and receive real-time tips. Once a person tips, we keep their card on file to make it easy to tip. Just like Youtube has Superthnks for chat tipping and Twitch as Sub tipping, FItclass also has tipping built right into the Zoom app during the training session with our partnership with Zoom. FItclass is free to join for both trainers and attendees. Since the Fitclass platform is free to everyone, it makes money by charging a small nominal service fee on top of classes and taking a small nominal fee from the tips. Among the different classes our trainers can train in are Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Kickboxing, Spinning, Zumba, Body Pump, CrossFit, Bootcamp, Body Combat, Barre, Hot Yoga, TRX, Insanity, P90X, Hot Pilates, Tai Chi, Bikram Yoga, Rowing, Kettlebell, and HIIT.\n\nAssistant:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=10, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None), prompt_token_ids: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.
